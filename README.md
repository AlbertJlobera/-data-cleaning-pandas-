<h2>Florida, the shark attack capital of the world</h2>

<h3>The American state has the most reported unprovoked shark attacks worldwide during summer and autumn</h3>

<p>After analyzing the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks" target="_blank">Shark Attack</a>&nbsp;dataset and studying the data offered, we asked ourselves the following question:&nbsp;<strong>where is the place with more unprovoked shark attacks and in which season do they take place?</strong></p>

<p>We started by cleaning up the dataset filtering by country and that is when we realized that the vast majority of unprovoked shark attacks were in the US and,&nbsp;in particular,<strong> in the state of Florida</strong>. The difference was noticeable, so we focused specifically on this area, dropping cases from the rest of the countries.</p>

<p>Once we had the case oriented for the southeast coast of the United States, we concentrated exclusively on unprovoked cases. We continued with another parameter in which we were interested: <strong>the most dangerous season</strong>. To answer our main question, we grouped the data by the month in which the attack took place. As we might have expected, <strong>the worst seasons to enjoy a swim in the beaches of Florida were summer and autumn</strong>.</p>

<p>In addition, during our research we have found some curious figures. For example, <strong>only the 1.81% of the victims died after the attack, the 34.77% were underage victims and the majority of them were men.</strong></p>

<p>This alarming situation has been published on several media and some newspapers such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/05/us/florida-3-shark-attacks-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/shark-attacks/yearly-worldwide-summary/" target="_blank">Florida Museum</a> have echoed news supporting our hypotheses. Therefore, our conclusion is to opt for safety and to avoid venturing without caution on the beaches of Florida, unless you go in winter.
